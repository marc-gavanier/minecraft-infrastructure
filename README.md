## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Terraform CLI](https://www.terraform.io/cli)

## Installation

The following command allows to use the Terraform command line via Docker:
```shell
docker run --rm -it --name terraform -v ~/:/root/ -v $(pwd):/workspace -w /workspace hashicorp/terraform:light
```

For simplified use, you can create an alias:
```shell
alias terraform='docker run --rm -it --name terraform -v ~/:/root/ -v $(pwd):/workspace -w /workspace hashicorp/terraform:light'
```

Using this alias, there is no longer any difference between a terraform command executed via Docker or via Terraform CLI.

## Usage

### Check and fix `.tf` files format

```shell
terraform fmt
```

### Verify ressources consistency

```shell
terraform validate
```

### Retrieve Terraform Cloud authentication token locally

```shell
terraform login
```

### Initialize state and plugins locally

```shell
terraform init
```

### Plan a run to check differences between the current and the next infrastructure state to be deployed

```shell
terraform plan
```

## Contribution

### Apply the next state of the infrastructure

Simply push the changes to the `main` branch, to apply the next state of the infrastructure in production,
